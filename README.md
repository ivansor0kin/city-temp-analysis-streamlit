# City Temperature Analysis Streamlit (file content is currently in Russian)

## Description

A solution for analyzing historical temperature data and monitoring the current temperature in selected cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. The project includes basic time series analysis, anomaly detection, seasonal profiling, and the development of an interactive web application.

### Access

The application is available at https://city-temp-analysis-service.streamlit.app/.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Analysis of Historical Time Series Data:
- Calculated 30-day moving average to smooth out temperature fluctuations.
- Computed seasonal mean temperature and standard deviation for each city.
- Identified temperature anomalies that fall outside the range:  
  $$ \text{moving average} \pm 2\sigma $$
- Built long-term temperature trends using linear regression.
- Explored the efficiency of parallel data processing:
  - Compared execution time of sequential vs parallel processing using `multiprocessing` and `concurrent.futures`.

### 2. Monitoring Current Temperature via OpenWeatherMap API:
- Integrated with OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current temperature for selected cities.
- Implemented a check to determine whether the current temperature is within the normal range for the current season based on historical data.
- Compared synchronous and asynchronous API requests to optimize response time.

### 3. Development of an Interactive Web Application:
- Built a Streamlit-based application providing the following features:
  - Upload a CSV file with historical temperature data.
  - Select a city from a dropdown list for analysis.
  - Display descriptive statistics for the selected city (mean, min, max temperature).
  - Plot a time series with moving average and highlight anomalies (optional toggle).
  - Visualize seasonal profiles with mean and standard deviation per season.
- Included a form for entering the OpenWeatherMap API key, with validation and JSON error message display if the key is invalid.
- Displayed current temperature with comparison to the historical seasonal range.

## Data Used

The historical temperature data is stored in the `temperature_data.csv` file and includes the following columns:
- `city`: Name of the city.
- `timestamp`: Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- `temperature`: Daily average temperature (in Â°C).
- `season`: Season of the year (`winter`, `spring`, `summer`, `autumn`).

## Technologies and Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit, aiohttp, requests, scikit-learn  
- **Parallel Processing:** `multiprocessing`, `concurrent.futures`  
- **API:** OpenWeatherMap  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud

## Results

- Historical temperature data was analyzed to detect anomalies and seasonal patterns.
- An interactive web application was developed for visualization and real-time temperature monitoring.
- A comparative analysis of synchronous vs asynchronous API request handling was performed.
- The solution was successfully deployed to the Streamlit Cloud platform.
